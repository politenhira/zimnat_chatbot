Zimnat Assists GMB Explosion Victims13 September 2018|In News, Newsletter|2 MinutesShare Post



Representatives of the Zimnat Group last week visited survivors of the explosion at the Grain Marketing Boards Lions Den depot and relatives of those who lost their lives in the explosion. They donated, on Zimnats behalf, $500 to each family.
At least four GMB employees lost their lives in the explosion, while three were seriously injured.
The total amount donated by Zimnat to the affected families was $3 000. The group also gave them Zimnat branded T-shirts.
Zimnat national sales manager Nunurai Mataringe, who led the delegation that visited the bereaved families and survivors, said the GMB is a client of Zimnats General Insurance Division, which provides shortterm insurance.
Although Zimnat only provides the GMB with short-term insurance, the Group as a whole felt moved to do something to assist those affected by the blast, he said
This was a tragic event affecting one of our clients and its employees. We wanted to do something to assist the bereaved and injured, even though they were not covered by our life or funeral policies.
This sad event does, of course, bring home the importance of having life and funeral insurance. Our insurance policies are intended to make life better for those covered by them. However, our wish to make life better is not limited to the insurance, asset management and microfinance services we provide.
That is why we felt inspired to visit and make donations to those affected by the GMB blast. It was so unexpected and so devastating that it is difficult to imagine its effect on those so suddenly bereaved and injured. Our hearts go out to them, he said.
While nothing can take away the pain of the loss they experienced, we hope that our donation will assist them, if only in a small way, in coping with the financial burdens they are faced with as a result of this blast.

Lets talk about SMART lending with Zimnat Microfinance9 May 2020|In News|5 MinutesShare Post



The Zimbabwean financial services landscape is experiencing some turbulence which as further exacerbated the need for client protection when it comes to microfinance.
The current inflationary pressures being experienced in the economy coupled with an increase in the number of players in the microfinance industry leaves borrowers in a rather vulnerable position.
According to the Reserve Bank Monetary Policy Statement for 2019, there are 205 microfinance institutions in operation.
With so many microfinance institutions and the rapid digitalisation of business processes, as well as a surge in the number of bogus loan sharks, it is easy in such a dynamic environment to be taken advantage of and caught up in a debt trap.
It is in these uncertain times that client protection becomes imperative to ensure a high level of ethics and integrity in the microfinance industry.
Armed with the Microfinance Act, regulators and service providers, like Zimnat microfinance have made a decent endeavour to place client protection at the forefront of the service delivery standards expected of registered microfinance institutions.
Microfinance institutions epitomize responsible financial inclusion, as such integrity and transparency are significant factors that any borrower should expect in all transactions with a lending institution.
Responsible microfinance institutions draw guidance on customer protection from the Microfinance Act as well as the 7 principles of client protection, which include but not limited to the prevention of over-indebtedness.
Responsible microfinanciers take all the necessary measures to ensure that a borrower still has the capacity to repay a loan without becoming over-indebted.
With the current fluid economic conditions, the propensity amongst individuals to borrow increases, as people try to subsidise their strained incomes. Many end up overburdened with debt. This is a very uncomfortable position to be in.
Although potential borrowers consciously apply for a loan in the full knowledge of their existing obligations, it is incumbent upon the lender to protect the client by ensuring that the borrower is not already suffering from too much debt.
With the help of the Reserve Bank, a Central Credit Registry has been established where all credit obligations to financial institutions are recorded.
This is one of a raft of measures put in place to ensure that financial institutions and would-be borrowers alike are not exploited.
It allows any credit institution to cross-reference information about a borrower to verify his or her credit status and help assess the clients borrowing capacity.
Zimnat as an organisation driven to make life better, has made deliberate efforts to guarantee client protection by embedding principles of smart lending and client protection in its service delivery channels, systems and processes.
Through the use of data analytics and customer success management Zimnat microfinance has been able to complement existing measures to help customers get the funding they need without falling into the debt trap.
Furthermore, keeping in line with the Microfinance Act as well as the client protection principles Zimnat Microfinance displays all the terms and conditions for its products at its premises to ensure borrowers have all the material facts for them to make a decision that does not lead to over-indebtedness.
In addition, strict data protection measures have also been put in place to ensure that customer information is being used only for the purposes for which it was requested.
With Zimnat, you can rest assured that you will be served by professionally trained staff offering high quality and affordable products and services to meet your financial needs.
With branches and resident agents scattered across the whole of Zimbabwe, Zimnat microfinance strives to ensure efficient and excellent customer service to meet your needs and make your life better.
Zimnat Microfinance has been in existence since 2012. It boasts of a solid financial background being, as it is, part of the Zimnat family.

Zimnat General Insurances  story began 76 years ago in 1946, but our journey to becoming a leading financial services group has been anything but ordinary. From humble beginnings as Zimnat General Insurance to our latest incarnation as Zimnat General Insurance, our focus has always been on innovation and serving our customers better.
Over the years, ICR continued to grow and expand its services, and in 1959, it acquired a life assurance company, which led to the formation of the Assurances Company of Zimbabwe. The companys success caught the eye of T.A Holdings, which had been founded as Tobacco Auctions Limited, and in 1969, they took over ICR.
Our rich history includes mergers with other industry leaders, such as Lion of Zimbabwe, and a major partnership with Sanlam, the largest non-banking financial services provider in Africa. Through this partnership, weve been able to grow and become a dominant player in the short-term insurance space in Zimbabwe and beyond.






Today, were proud to have a diverse range of services and resources that empower individuals to realize their full potential and achieve their desired financial objectives. With an AA+ GCR credit rating  and offices in Harare, Gweru, Mutare, and Bulawayo, were well-positioned to serve our customers throughout Zimbabwe.
Whether youre just starting out as an investor or youre looking for a trusted partner to help you navigate the complex world of finance, were here to help. Join us on this exciting journey, and lets make life better together.

Zimnat Family Funeral Plan explained14 November 2019|In News|7 MinutesShare Post



By Talent Doroba
From the dawn of time men have strived to come up with solutions to lifes challenges that make life better and advance generational development.
One of the many ways in which our forefathers safeguarded generational growth was by adopting risk mitigating measures that ensured that the shocks of life were easily absorbed without being too detrimental to the victims.
Benjamin Franklin wrote in a letter in 1749 that nothing can be said to be certain except death and taxes and the former is a great source of anxiety and risk.
Zimnat Life Assurance ,a part of the Zimnat Group whose purpose is to make life better, offers the Zimnat Family Funeral Plan, which is a tried and tested diverse funeral cash plan designed to provide financial relief in ones time of need.
As highlighted by its name, this is a family funeral policy that can cover every member of the family. With Zimnat Family Funeral Plan we will cover both your nuclear and extended family. Nuclear family cover will include you as the principal member, your spouse, children and parents, while the extended family member cover will include family members that do not qualify as part of the nuclear family who you may want to be covered.
It is hard to save in these difficult times. Taking out a Zimnat Family Funeral Plan insulates your family from high funeral costs. As highlighted by Benjamin Franklin, we cannot run away from death. However we can prepare for it in a manner that safeguards the financial well-being of our loved ones when it finally arrives.
While a funeral service policy will ensure we have a decent burial, it is imperative that we also think about the lives of our loved ones after the funeral. That is why it is crucial to have a funeral cash plan.
A funeral cash plan policy guarantees a cash pay-out to your registered beneficiaries in the event of the passing away of one of the registered policy members.
The Zimnat Family Funeral Plan does not limit financial assistance to funeral expenses alone. There are three categories of financial need that the plan provides for.
The first category is pre-death expenses, that is expenses incurred while still alive.  The Zimnat Family Funeral Plan offers access to loans through Zimnat Financial Services. These include   business loans, housing loans, salary-based loans and asset financing that are accessible to all instantaneously.
No one chooses when and how they become vulnerable to ailments. Some ailments last only a few hours, while others might confine you to hospital for months. The Family Funeral Plan has a hospital cash benefit of $50 per day up to the day of discharge, with the minimum hours of admission to qualify for this being 48 hours. Should the hospitalised patient die, the daily cash benefit will be paid to his or her beneficiaries.
The Zimnat Family Funeral Plan also rewards the policy holder with a No Claims Bonus, if his/her policy runs for five years without a death benefit being claimed. The bonus amounts to 20 percent of the five years total premium contributions.
The second category is expenses during the funeral. This is when a person covered by the funeral plan has passed on. It is the main risk which all the benefits are pinned on.
The policy has funeral cover starting from $500 up to $10 000, depending on the premium paid. The lowest premium is 20 cents per day.
This benefit is only realised when a person covered by the policy passes on. It is intended to assist with funeral arrangement expenses not covered by a funeral service policy.
The third category is the post burial period, the dry period with regards to declining income streams due to the breadwinner having passed on.
It generally takes three months for pension pay-outs to be made. This time of waiting can be a financial strain on the surviving family members. The Zimnat Family Funeral Plan ensures that this mourning period is less financially burdensome with its flexible sum assured, which offers the flexibility to either claim during the funeral or after it in order to meet post-burial expenses.
In addition to the post-burial financial pay out option, the Zimnat Family Funeral Plan also offers an optional add-on benefit of a vigil and tombstone cover of $3 000 paid out a year after the death.
Staying true to our promise of making life better, the Zimnat Family Funeral Plan allows the beneficiaries to carry on with the plan, with the first annual premium of the policy being paid for.
We understand that the death of a breadwinner has a profound psychological and financial impact on the well-being of the family. Zimnat is committed to playing its part in easing the financial pressures for the year.
Zimnat guarantees flexible premium payment terms. That means you can choose how often you want to pay the subscriptions. You can choose to pay monthly, quarterly, semi-annually or annually.
Zimnat is associated with Sanlam, the largest non-banking financial institution on the continent. The company offers businesses and individuals a variety of products including motor insurance, home insurance, life assurance, travel insurance, funeral cover, health and accident insurance, pension schemes, unit trusts and private wealth management.

Zimnat partners PROWEB to offer free cataract removal surgery14 November 2019|In News|3 MinutesShare Post



The promotion of health and emotional wellness is a cause that has defined Zimnats corporate social footprint as it continues to seek to make life better for the communities in which it operates.
Zimnat recently partnered with the Professional Women, Women Executives and Business Womens Forum (PROWEB) to offer free eye cataract surgery to hundreds of people affected by the condition in Zimbabwe.
A team of doctors from Spain under the Elena Barraquer Foundation, working with local doctors, performed the operations at Chitungwiza Central Hospital from September 23 to 28.
The foundation is an offshoot of the Barraquer Opthalmology Centre, a top Spanish Eye Hospital in Barcelona which has for years undertaken similar eye projects in Africa.
More than 200 people from Harare, Mahusekwa, Marondera, Dema, Mount Darwin, Madziva and Shurugwi benefitted from the programme, undergoing successful cataract removal operations.
Supporting this programme, which assisted so many people affected by eye cataracts, is in line with Zimnats commitment to making life better.
Several of the beneficiaries of the programme could not hide their joy after the surgery and expressed their gratitude to Zimnat and the organisers for coming to their aid.
Most of the beneficiaries had been living with the condition for some time but had failed to raise the amount required for surgery.
This programme is one of a number that Zimnat has been involved in this year that have made an impact on peoples lives.
Some of the notable initiatives include donations to children living with disabilities, construction of an ablution block for girls at a primary school in Epworth and providing roofing for schools affected by Cyclone Idai.
The company is driven by a purpose to make life better. It is associated with the Sanlam Group, the largest non-banking financial institution on the continent.
The Zimnat group has four business units, namely Asset Management, Life Assurance, General Insurance and Microfinance.

Zimnat Comes To The Aid Of Melfort Old Peoples Home9 May 2019|In News|2 MinutesShare Post



Zimnat has come to the aid of Melfort Old Peoples Home by providing free insurance cover for the homes two vehicles for a whole year.
The home, which recently had a combi and a sedan donated to it, approached the Zimnat Group for assistance with insuring these vehicles. Zimnat responded by insuring the two vehicles free of charge.
Located along Mutare road, Melfort Old Peoples Home, which is registered with Help Age,  has the capacity to accommodate 60 elderly residents, most of whom have been referred to it by the social welfare department. Others come from Harare and Marondera hospitals.
The institution faces a number of challenges, among them lack of a consistent food supply and adequate manpower. Currently there are only two superintendents who are employed by Help Age Zimbabwe and a part-time nurse.
Following the assistance rendered with insurance, Zimnat has scheduled a visit to the home to assess its needs and see how best it can further assist it.
The Chairperson of Melfort Old Peoples Home approached Zimnat Group to ask for assistance with vehicle insurance cover after the institution received a donation of two vehicles.
We agreed to provide cover for the two vehicles for the whole year to ensure that the vehicles are on the road legally, Zimnat group chief executive Mustafa Sachak said.
We also discovered that there are a lot of other challenges the home is facing including deaths of residents, food shortages and lack of manpower. We will look, therefore, at how best we can further assist, he said.
Zimnat is a diversified financial group that offers products across the financial and insurance spectrum. It has four business units namely Zimnat General Insurance, Zimnat Life Assurance, Zimnat Financial Services and Zimnat Asset Management.
Zimnat, making life better!

The difference between Life Insurance and Funeral Insurance7 May 2021|In Blog, News|7 MinutesShare Post



                                                                   By 
                                                      Joshua Mhlanga 
 
Life insurance
This is a contract offered to an individual seeking to cover themselves or their loved ones against the financial consequences that ensue in the event of the death of the insured individual. The insurer makes a commitment to pay out a lump sum amount as a benefit known as the sum assured to a policyholders chosen beneficiaries. Although usually offered to a single life, some may be priced such that the policyholders spouse is also covered under the same policy, which is called a joint whole life contract.
Funeral Insurance
This contract is taken up solely for the purpose of reducing the financial strains that come with processes involved in making sure that a loved one is given a decent burial. The selected beneficiaries of the covered live(s) are entitled to lump sum pay outs and/or services upon death.
                                           What makes them look Similar?
Benefits payable  Both contracts pay out a lump sum amount upon death of the covered life. The contracts may also be priced in such a way that the policyholder participates in the products profit contribution to the insurance company. The profit will be mentioned in the terms and condition as it may be investment, underwriting or a combination of the two.
Zimnat Life Assurance recently launched two products in March 2021, LifeCare Plan and Security Plan. These products  offer policyholders an opportunity to participate in sharing profits realised from the sale of the policies. These contracts are designed in such a way that the insurer promises to give rewards if the pool of funds in which premiums are invested in performs, these rewards may be in the form of a lump sum pay-out, premium waiver or an escalation on the sum assured depending on the design of the product.
Eligibility  Almost all insurance contracts can be offered to anyone between 18 and 65 years.
Premium frequency  The insurance benefit is offered in exchange for a premium , the rate at which premiums are paid may also vary from monthly, quarterly and bi-annually.
Premium payment period  Depending on the contract, the contributions towards cover may be paid for a set period, this type of contract is called Whole life with Limited Premium Paying Term, while some may require one to pay in perpetuity until death.
                                             So how are they different?
Usage of pay out  Life insurance cover proceeds may be used to meet inheritance tax liability when winding up the estate of the deceased or to pay off any loans or mortgages that the insured had. It may also be used to purchase an annuity that will be used to pay schools fees amongst other uses.
For a funeral contract,  a lump sum is usually paid immediately (within 24 hours of notification) on death to cover all the necessary funeral logistics. So in essence the life insurance contract is taken by the insured so that (s)he safeguards the well-being of those that (s)he leaves behind, while the funeral contract is taken by the insured to make sure that those left behind do not have to worry about financing a proper send off for their loved one.
Magnitude of Sum Assured  a life insurance contract has a significantly higher sum assured value while a funeral insurance contract usually has a lower sum assured. This is mainly so because of the  differences in purpose of the covers discussed above.
Underwriting  due to the differences in the sum assured each insurance type is subject to different levels of underwriting conditions. Since the life insurance contact offers a high sum assured the lives to be covered may be subject to medical inspection. Whereas the most common underwriting factor considered for a funeral insurance contract is age.
Benefit Options  Not only does the funeral insurance contract offer monetary benefits, the cover may also render services which include provision of body removal, funeral rites, transport and catering needed on the day of the funeral. In addition, the contract may further give a tombstone and unveiling service benefits. Zimnat offers such services through FSG Zimbabwe.
Lives covered per policy  With a funeral insurance contact one may also choose to cover more lives apart from theirs, these are called co-lives, the addition of these lives has a bearing on the premiums
In conclusion, when the purpose of something is unknown, abuse, overuse or no use at all is inevitable. My hope is next time you want to choose insurance for yourself and/or family, you will be well equipped by the information that has been availed, so that you make the best decision.

Zimnat marathon beneficiary scheduled for surgery25 August 2019|In News|2 MinutesShare Post



Cebisani Ndlovu, the 30-year-old Bulawayo man for whom Zimnat organised a fund-raising marathon last November, is provisionally booked for spinal surgery in the second week of next month.
The half-marathon Zimnat organised at Barclays Sports Club in Harare to raise funds for Mr Ndlovus spinal surgery raised almost $7 000, only $500 short of the $7 500 it was estimated at the time would be required for the surgery.
So far Zimnat has paid $8 654.94 for hospitalisation, doctors fees, a surgical assistant and the anaesthetist, in addition to $550 for a Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scan.
We are glad to have been able to make Cebisanis surgery possible. His surgery has been tentatively scheduled for the second week of February.
We should like to thank all those who helped us to help Cebisani by participating in the marathon we organised on November 10 last year, said Zimnat group marketing executive Angela Mpala.
There was a huge turnout for the marathon, with 740 people taking part in the half-marathon or shorter runs, while others who did not run donated towards the total amount raised for Mr Ndlovus surgery.
Mr Ndlovu, who has difficulty walking, even with the aid of crutches, which he first started using in Form One, witnessed the fund-raising marathon and chatted to some of the participants.
Zimnat is committed to making life better for others. We were moved by the plea of this young man, who holds a Bachelor of Commerce Honours degree in Risk Management and Insurance but has been unable to obtain a job due to his disability.
We decided to ask members of the public to help us assist him and they responded magnificently, she said.

Zimnat honours its salesforce in ritzy style22 March 2022|In Events, News|3 MinutesShare Post



 
Zimnat Group CEO Mustafa Sachak (centre) pictured with the award-winning members of the salesforce and  Zimnat executives
 
Zimnat, a leading financial services group has once again painted the city green with the return of its glitzy Annual Agents Awards ceremony. The latest edition was held at the prestigious Cresta Lodge in Harare on Friday the 18th  of March 2022. The glamorous event is hosted annually to recognize and celebrate high-performing sales agents in the group, in line with the Zimnat culture of celebrating success and high performers. The event was attended by sales agents from all over Zimbabwe as well as executives from the group and some of its banking partners.
 
In his welcome remarks, Mustafa Sachak, Zimnat group chief executive officer said it is the companys culture to always recognize hard work and celebrate it. The annual agents awards ceremony is the pinnacle of this recognition program.
 
Whilst the COVID-19 pandemic negatively impacted us from an economic and social perspective, it also helped expedite our digitalization agenda to continue delivering on our promise to our customers. This resolve to make life better extends to how our agent salesforce evolved in a way that has seen us bouncing back with better results in the 2021 financial year. Today we honour those agents that were exceptional within our high-performing salesforce. One of our biggest drivers is exceptional customer service and these people getting awards today have displayed a commitment to both hard work and exceptional service delivery.
 
By celebrating and encouraging our sales agents and staff we want them to be motivated to provide exceptional service to our clients. We want to empower the company and clients to reach their full potential, Mr Sachak said.
 
The awards ceremony which was dominated by female agents could not have come at a better time than in the month in which the world is celebrating women. A woman of note was Sheron Mange a life insurance sales agent who was recognized as the top-performing sales agent.  She broke the bias by growing her portfolio by ten times from its 2020 record.
Sheron pictured receiving an award from Zimnat Life MD Workmore Chimweta and flanked by Zimnat Group CEO Mustafa Sachak
Not to be outdone were sales agents in the general insurance and microfinance space, Gardiner Maponga and Godfrey Huseni. Gardiner Maponga has been with the group selling insurance for more than 2 decades and is growing his portfolio consistently same with Godfrey.
 
Zimnat is a diversified financial services group that offers products across the financial and insurance spectrum. It has four business units namely Zimnat General Insurance, Zimnat Life Assurance, Zimnat Financial Services, Zimnat Asset Management, and is associated with the Sanlam Group.

In the late 1940s, a group of visionaries set out to create an insurance company that would serve the people of Rhodesia. They founded the Insurance Company of Rhodesia (ICR) in 1946, and it quickly became a leading provider of insurance services in the region.
Over the years, ICR continued to grow and expand its services, and in 1959, it acquired a life assurance company, which led to the formation of the Assurances Company of Zimbabwe. The companys success caught the eye of T.A Holdings, which had been founded as Tobacco Auctions Limited, and in 1969, they took over ICR.
In 1974, the company underwent a major transformation, as it shifted its focus to the farming sector. It was renamed the Rhodesia National Farmers Union Insurance Society, and it became known in the informal sector as Rhodesia National Insurance (RhoNat). However, the winds of change were blowing, and after the independence of Zimbabwe in 1980, the company once again changed its name to Zimnat Insurance Company, still operating under a composite license.
But the story doesnt end there. In 1984, T.A Holdings made a bold decision to split the composite license and form two separate companies: Zimnat Insurance Company and Zimnat Life Assurance Company. This move allowed the company to focus on providing the best possible services in their respective areas of expertise.
Today, Zimnat Life Assurance is a leader in the Zimbabwean insurance industry, offering a wide range of life assurance and investment products to individuals, families, and businesses. The companys journey has been one of resilience, innovation, and adaptability, and it continues to thrive and serve the people of Zimbabwe with distinction.

AnnuitiesZimnat offers several types of annuity products for retirees. The Conventional Annuity with Guaranteed Escalation is an investment product where a single premium is paid and a monthly pension (annuity) is received by the retiree. The annuity is guaranteed for a minimum period and will continue to be paid for life after that period, even if the retiree passes away. The annuity increases regularly at a guaranteed interest rate chosen by the retiree, which is not linked to actual investment performance. This product is suitable for older retirees and protects them from adverse market fluctuations.
The With Profit Guaranteed Annuity is similar to the Conventional Annuity with Guaranteed Escalation, but also includes additional bonus additions to protect the retiree from the effects of inflation. The annuity increases annually at both the minimum guaranteed interest rate and an additional increase based on investment performance.
The Fixed Term Annuity is a type of conventional annuity product that is targeted at surviving children. The payment is guaranteed for a fixed term regardless of when the beneficiary dies and the payment ceases at the expiry of the policy term. The annuity will be increased regularly through bonus declarations by the company.
The Flexi Annuity is a unit-linked investment plan where the retiree can choose the level of monthly pension they would like to receive from a range provided by the insurer. The balance capital value of the annuity is paid out upon the retirees death. The annuity increases based on the investment performance of the underlying assets. The insurer manages the annuity to prevent the capital from being exhausted before the death of the retiree. The pensioner carries the investment risk, and pension payments are not guaranteed as they can be reduced depending on investment performance. The retiree can also benefit from critical mass in investment of lump-sum amounts, and retirement income is tax exempt.

Zimnat Launches Innovative Billboard Campaign14 September 2018|In News, Newsletter|3 MinutesShare Post



Zimnat has launched an innovative advertising campaign to let people know some of the ways in which it can make their life better, through the customer friendly insurance and finance services it offers.
Billboards have now been added to the campaign, which has already been promoted through television and the print media. The emphasis is on how Zimnat makes life better in different ways. Journalists were taken today to see some of them in Harare.
Some executions speak to the ease and speed with which insurance claims are lodged and processed as well as how Zimnat can help one recover should an unfortunate event befall one.
However, there is also a corporate social responsibility element to one of its billboards along Borrowdale Road, which shows the chalk outline of a body and, using texting shorthand, carries the warning message pll ovr, dnt txt n drv.
The other billboards use similarly dramatic executions. Two of the billboards, one by Coke Corner and another on Robert Mugabe Road, have a large head and shoulders image emerging from the billboard of a man who looks frustrated and as if he is about to blow his top. The billboard message reads: We pay claims quickly to save you the stress. This billboard is certain to grab the attention of those who pass by it.
Another billboard, at the intersection of Lomagundi Road and Sam Nujoma Street, shows a man who looks worried and seems to be pulling out the billboard in frustration over the claim forms he has to fill in. The corner of the billboard has been physically pulled off. The message reads: Is this what your claims process looks like? Rather insure with us.
Perhaps the most dramatic is a billboard on Julius Nyerere Way at Joina City, which has an actual car incorporated in it. Dont get stuck. Let us make your life better, the billboard reads.
Zimnat provides wealth creation, income protection and risk management solutions through its four business units. These are General Insurance, Life Assurance, Asset Management and Microfinance.
The company offers businesses and individuals a variety of products to give them peace of mind. These include motor insurance, home insurance, life assurance, travel insurance, funeral cover, health and accident insurance, pension schemes, unit trusts and private wealth management.
Zimnat is associated with Sanlam, one of the largest financial services groups in South Africa and the biggest non-banking financial services group in Africa.
Our aim is to make life better for others. This advertising campaign is intended to increase awareness of the many ways in which we can do this, commented Zimnat Group Marketing Executive Angela Mpala.

Employers can establish schemes to give employees peace of mind9 May 2020|In News|5 MinutesShare Post



In an economy facing a shrinking disposable income and personal life insurance is fast becoming an afterthought, the importance of employer assisted insurance schemes has never been more critical. Employer assisted schemes can help employees prepare for the different stages of their lives and that of their families. These schemes help ensure that in the event of their death, their dependants can continue living a normal and comfortable life.
Zimnat Life Assurance is offering employers several solutions to help them make their employees better by ensuring they live their best lives without worrying about tomorrow because Zimnat Life will take care of everything.
Group Life Assurance Schemes. 
The Zimnat Life Group Life Assurance Plan is an insurance scheme an employer can take out to cover the lives of employees. The scheme ensures that a lump sum payment is made to the beneficiaries of an employee who passes on. It is worth to note that the benefit is only payable if the employee passes on whilst in the service of the employer. The employer is responsible for paying the premiums for this insurance cover.
The lump sum benefit due to the surviving dependants is paid as a multiple of the employees annual salary. In addition to the above stated benefits the employer has the option of adding more benefits to their employees covers such as cover for total and permanent disability. Furthermore, employers can add the group funeral insurance which can guarantee their employees get a decent funeral in the event of their untimely passing.
Pension Fund 
A pension fund can be defined as a financial vehicle to which the employer and employees contribute for the ultimate financial benefit of the employee and his family at retirement, retrenchment, death, disablement or termination of employment. Many people are scared of retirement because they do not have a financial back-up plan. Pension funds can help you stay in control of your life, as if you never left employment. The Zimnat Employee benefits scheme also offer employers the opportunity to contribute to a pension fund for their employees guaranteeing them of a comfortable life after retirement.
Credit Life Protection
The Zimnat Life Credit Life Protection scheme ensures that Zimnat Life Assurance will meet the financial obligations due to the employees in the event of their death or permanent disability. Debt settlement is one of the most difficult adjustment for most dependants in the event of the breadwinners death or incapacitation, and the Zimnat credit life protection scheme was developed to ease such burdens.
Mortgage Protection
Settling of mortgages in the event of the death of the breadwinners is a common predicament that several families are going through. With the Zimnat Mortgage Protection scheme, employers are guaranteeing the settlement of outstanding mortgage balances of their employees in the event of their permanent incapacitation or untimely death. Zimnat life guarantees payment of the outstanding mortgage balance in the event of the death or total and permanent disablement of the borrower who was insured under the mortgage protection scheme. With this policy employers enable their employees surviving families to retain ownership of property in the event of the death of the employee without fear of such properties being repossessed. 
Financial Planning 
Pension Funds and Group Life Assurance schemes are very useful safety nets for the future, however despite their benefits they an employers attempt to providing the bare minimum cushioning. Sound individual financial planning cannot be an afterthought if one wants to guarantee a comfortable life for their dependants. Taking the time to speak to a Zimnat Financial advisor is the first step towards financial freedom and comfort that everyone needs.
Regular Reviews
To ensure the maximum benefit of these schemes, there is need for a constant review of your financial plan to match the economic environment. One must constantly review their plans to align with the changing needs of the future.

Diaspora Funeral Cash Plan Communique1 October 2019|In News|9 MinutesShare Post



Zimnat would like to clear the air and give accurate information with respect to Diaspora Funeral Cash Plan (DFCP) policies. The background to this are the recent media reports surrounding alleged changes to the above existing policies.
The relationship between Zimnat and Destiny Financial Services T/A as DFCP
Since January 2012, Destiny Financial Services has been an appointed agent of Zimnat Life Assurance for the DFCP product with the primary mandate to promote, market and extend the sale of funeral cover plans to Zimbabweans in the diaspora through online channels for a commission. To this end and in line with insurance laws, Zimnat operated and continues to operate as the underwriter. An underwriter is a registered life office whose primary responsibilities are to assume the insured risk against payment of the applicable premium, issue policy documents, maintain the policy and settle claims from policy holders in line with the terms and conditions of the product. The relationship between the client and the underwriter begins the moment a policy application has been accepted and a policy document has been issued, subject to payment of premiums.
The Nature of the DFCP Product
DFCP is a long-term funeral cover where one pays premiums for twenty years (20) and is covered for the rest of their lives after the premium paying period. An important point is that premiums must be paid consistently to maintain cover. A lapse will occur where a policy holder fails to pay premiums for a consecutive period of three (3) months. If a policy lapses, unfortunately, all benefits under the policy are lost. The insurance industry is a highly regulated industry. The DFCP product is registered as is required by law with the Insurance and Pension Commission (IPEC) of Zimbabwe and the exchange control division of the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ). IPEC, the insurance regulator in Zimbabwe and RBZ, have approved the issuing of policies in foreign currency for Zimbabweans living in the diaspora. These policies shall be maintained and paid out in foreign currency.
The migration of policies to another insurer
The DFCP policy is a contract between the policy holder and the underwriter. Both the policy holder and underwriter have to agree to a migration of the policy to another underwriter or to any material change of the products or its terms and conditions. A third party, such as a marketing agent like Destiny Financial Services, has no power to migrate a policy to another underwriter or otherwise change the product or its terms. Zimnat has not moved or authorised the movement of policies or contract to any new provider or underwriter.
Security of funds against currency and country risk
Due to the prevailing macro-economic environment in Zimbabwe and upon the request of Zimnat, RBZ has granted authority to ring fence funds related to DFCP for investment offshore. This guarantees the ability of Zimnat as the underwriter to settle claims in the currency contracted. Further to this it is important to underscore the security of policy holder funds with Zimnat for the following reasons:

Zimnat is a leading financial services brand in Zimbabwe
Zimnat is in partnership with Sanlam, which is the largest non-banking financial services company on the African continent
Zimnat has a Global Credit rating of A-
Zimnat works with the best local and global reinsurers available
Zimnat employs and has access to the best actuaries in the world

Zimnat responses to some specific allegations made through the media
1. The currency volatility in Zimbabwe is very bad for long term investments like DFCP adoption of RTGS as the official currency wiping off peoples USD savings, investments and policies. 
Our Response

IPEC and RBZ have given authority to ring fence funds related to DFCP for investment offshore with a view to guarantee the ability of Zimnat as the underwriter to settle claims in the currency and to the value contracted.
The Government of Zimbabwe has been unequivocally supportive of diaspora related products. Circular 13 of 2019 from IPEC dealing with the authority to offer selected insurance policies in foreign currency, coming after the gazetting of Statutory Instrument (S.I) 142 Of 2019, gives provisions to this effect.
As a policy, Zimnat engages internationally reputed Re-Insurers to carry any risk that Zimnat cannot carry, including but not limited to currency related risk. In simple terms, Zimnat has in place sufficient protections to guarantee the settlement of all DFCP claims in foreign currency.

2. Policy holders lost money on Gadziriro (USD Funeral cover)
Our Response

Gadziriro (USD Funeral cover) is a local product. As promulgated by Circular 13 of 2019 from IPEC dealing with the    authority to offer selected insurance policies in foreign currency, coming after the gazetting of Statutory Instrument (S.I) 142 of 2019, existing foreign currency- denominated products (like Gadziriro) shall run to their natural expiry. Claims will be settled in the contracted currency.

3. Zimnat Life operates 100% in Zimbabwe and invest in bond notes/ RTGS
Our Response

Zimnat is part of the Sanlam group, which is the largest non-banking financial services company on the continent, with a footprint across 33 countries and has over 90 operating businesses in Africa and Asia. Our investment portfolio is likewise diversified into different investment locations, investment types and investment currencies

4. Zimnat Is Refusing to be dropped as an Underwriter
Our Response

It is not possible to drop an underwriter from an insurance policy or contract. The alleged dropping of Zimnat as an underwriter by Destiny Finance is a non-event.
Zimnat cannot stop a non-exclusive agent like Destiny Finance from engaging an underwriter of their choice, particularly to sell new business. However, Zimnat as a responsible financial services provider with a fiduciary responsibility to policy holders, has an obligation to all/ existing clients to give them sound financial advice. Zimnat also has an obligation to support existing policy holders in their decision making with regards to their policy.
In this instance, our existing policy holders stand to potentially lose in the event of lapsing their policy. It is not possible for Destiny Finance to transfer the Zimnat Life policy to another insurer. It is therefore incumbent upon the policy holder to satisfy themselves as to the terms and conditions of any prospective new policy on offer. Zimnat is available to provide clarity, support and any other services that might be required by its clients.

Zimnats commitment to our current and future clients
Zimnat will honour and pay all obligations as they fall due for policies that remain valid. Zimnat looks forward to maintaining policies for our existing policy holders. Should you require any clarity, kindly call us or WhatsApp us +263772175991 or reply to the email customercare@zimnat.co.zw.

The Awakening of a sleeping giant: Zimnats journey of brand transformation.9 May 2020|In News|4 MinutesShare Post



By Gamuchirai Sibanda
 The story of an exceptional brand reinvigoration process is not complete without a tale of how Zimnat dared to do it and succeeded. This is a remarkable story of how an organisation that had been perceived as  a preserve for the elderly and wealthy managed to turn around its perception in the market into a more adept, and youthful brand that has the ability to offer a holistic financial services package for the millennial and Gen Z customer as well.
In 2015 Sanlam Emerging Markets acquired 40% stake in the Zimnat companies namely Life Assurance, General Insurance and Asset Management from Masawara Insurance in a move that saw the business embarking on a rebranding journey in 2017. The rebranding journey saw all the associated companies adopting the Zimnat brand name, colours, logo as well as a new and commonly shared purpose of making life better. The rebranding efforts to reiterate the new mission for the group have seen the organisation making headlines on a number of corporate social responsibility initiatives which include the Charity Marathon for Cebisani Ndlovus surgery, Chizungu Ablution block donation just to mention a few.
In addition to changing the look and feel as well as the purpose, the organisation also embarked on an intensive internal rebranding exercise. Realising the importance of an internal cultural shift in any rebranding exercise Zimnat has been engaging in a number of culture transformation initiatives which included the Pay it forward campaign which was aimed at reinforcing the new company purpose.
This rebranding journey is still an ongoing process which has already started to bear remarkable results as was witnessed at the 2019 Exceptional Marketing Awards for Excellence where Zimnat dominated the awards ceremony winning 8 awards out of the 15 categories it was nominated for. The recent successes can be attributed to the ongoing efforts by the organisation to promote and reinforce its commitment of making life better through some outstanding creative advertising which includes the famous award-winning car crash billboard. The 2019 success comes after the organisation also made a huge impression in 2018 as well managing to scoop 5 awards at the same event, this was a huge improvement for an organisation that did not receive an award of marketing excellence in the year 2017. A clear testament of the awakening of the great financial services giant that Zimnat is meant to be.
This remarkable turnaround success can be attributed to the outstanding commitment from the staff that were willing to embrace the new business ideals and were great ambassadors for the organisation.
Zimnat, a diversified financial services group made up of four business units, namely Zimnat General Insurance, Zimnat Life Assurance, Zimnat Financial Services and Zimnat Asset Management. It is associated with Sanlam, which is the largest non-banking financial services group on the continent

Be a cool cat who makes smart money moves with life insurance13 April 2023|In Blog, Confidence Boosters!|3 MinutesShare Post



Are you a young person who thinks life insurance is just another boring corporate product? Think again! Life insurance can actually be an exciting and inspirational way to safeguard the value of your hard-earned money for your kids.
At Zimnat, we understand that young people often view life insurance as something they dont need yet, or worse, as a morbid topic to be avoided at all costs. But heres the truth: life insurance is not just about death benefits. In fact, our Life Care plan and Security Plan policies are designed to help policyholders enjoy the benefits of their policies whilst they are still alive!
Yes, you read that right.
With Zimnats Life Care plan and Security Plan, you can benefit from an annual no-claims bonus, which means that you could actually receive money back from your policy even if you dont make any claims. And if the products register a profit in that financial year, policyholders also have an opportunity to participate in the profit sharing!
Now, you might be wondering why a young person like you needs life insurance. After all, youre young, healthy, and have your whole life ahead of you, right? But think about this: what if something unexpected were to happen? What if you were diagnosed with a serious illness or were involved in a life-changing accident? Would your loved ones be able to cope financially if you were unable to work or provide for them?
Thats where life insurance comes in. By investing in a Life Care plan or Security Plan policy now, you can ensure that your loved ones are financially protected in the event of the unexpected. Plus, by taking out a policy now, youll benefit from lower premiums as youll be younger and healthier, meaning youll pay less for your cover.
But its not just about financial protection. By taking out a life insurance policy, youre also investing in your own future. Youre creating a safety net that will allow you to pursue your dreams and passions without worrying about the financial implications. Whether you want to start your own business, travel the world, or simply enjoy life to the fullest, a life insurance policy can help you achieve your goals and aspirations.

Zimnat Exhibits At Harare Agricultural Show For First Time28 August 2018|In News|3 MinutesShare Post



Zimnat is marking its inaugural participation in the Harare Agricultural Show by providing visitors to the show with the opportunity to sign up for an insurance policy and to win branded Zimnat prizes in a variety of ways.
Its stand is similar to any of its offices both in ambience and in the service offered to customers. Visitors to the stand can make general enquiries, sign up for an insurance policy or alter an existing policy, in the same way as they could at any Zimnat branch.
Those who sign up for any of Zimnats policies will walk away with a branded gift. Those who refer friends and relatives to Zimnat to sign up for a policy will stand a chance of winning a prize.
There is also a pop a balloon opportunity to win an instant prize. There are balloons at the stand within which there is a paper with the name of a prize written on it. All a person has to do to win one of these instant prizes is to visit the Zimnat stand, refer a client and pop a balloon.
There will also be a quiz at the stand every day during the show at 4pm, with a prize for every correct answer.
Visitors to the stand will have an opportunity to meet Zimat financial advisors to discuss various investment options and seek advice on how to plan for their future financially.
In addition to insurance and life assurance, Zimnat offers financial services and asset management.
The Zimnat Group is comprised of Zimnat Life Assurance, Zimnat General Insurance, Zimnat Financial Services, Zimnat Asset Management and the recently launched Funeral Services Group, which is underwritten by Zimnat Life Assurance.
The group is associated with Sanlam, one of the largest   financial services groups in South Africa and the biggest non-banking financial services group in Africa.
Commenting on why Zimnat had decided for the first time to exhibit at the show, Zimnat Group marketing executive Angela Mpala said its participation had been inspired by a desire to provide those attending the show with information about and access to its policies and services.
Zimnat is committed to providing its customers and potential customers with convenience and service excellence wherever they are. We would like, therefore, to offer our customers the convenience of being able to do their business with us while they are at the show.
We believe the products and services we offer can make peoples lives better. We are eager, therefore, to give visitors to the show the opportunity to enquire what we have to offer them and how the policies and services we offer can improve their lives, she said.

Pinktober: Breast Cancer Awareness Month16 October 2018|In News|3 MinutesShare Post



Taking place annually throughout the month of October, Breast Cancer Awareness Month aims to raise awareness about the disease and raise funds for research into its cause, prevention, diagnosis, treatment and cure.
While the general public are often aware of the conditions much more action needs to be taken to support the public in reducing their risks and support early detection and treatment.

About breast cancer
Breast cancer is the second most common cancer globally, accounting for 1.7 million new diagnoses in 2012, a 20% increase in 2008 figures. Of even greater concern is that breast cancer has become the leading cause of mortality amongst women globally. While breast cancer incidence is higher in high-income countries (HICs) we have seen the fastest rise in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) where survival rates are the lowest.
Yet we have the tools to take action to dramatically reduce breast cancer risks, and as a result the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) amongst others has called for urgent global action to tackle this rapidly rising burden.

Symptoms
Many of the symptoms of breast cancer are invisible and not noticeable without a professional screening like a mammogram or ultrasound. But some symptoms can be caught early just by looking out for certain changes in your breasts and being proactive about your breast health.
The most common symptom of breast cancer is a new lump or mass. A painless, hard mass that has irregular edges is more likely to be cancer, but breast cancers can be tender, soft, or rounded. They can even be painful. For this reason, it is important to have any new breast mass, lump, or breast change checked by a health care professional experienced in diagnosing breast diseases.
Other possible symptoms of breast cancer include:

Swelling of all or part of a breast (even if no distinct lump is felt)
Skin irritation or dimpling (sometimes looking like an orange peel)
Breast or nipple pain
Nipple retraction (turning inward)
Redness, scaliness, or thickening of the nipple or breast skin
Nipple discharge (other than breast milk)

How often should I check my breasts?
It doesnt matter when you check your breasts, as long as you check them regularly. This could be every month, or every couple of months. You could check while youre in the bath or shower, after the gym or before bed.
When you get to know your breasts, you might notice they change with age, or at different times of the month. For example, your breasts might feel tender and lumpy around the time of your period. You may also experience normal changes during pregnancy, when your breasts may get bigger and feel tender or sore.

Zimnat Social Media Followers Win Trip To Cape Town Marathon29 August 2019|In News|5 MinutesShare Post



By Byron Adonis Mutingwende
Zimnat today announced the social media winners of an all-expenses-paid trip to Capetown to participate in the Sanlam Marathon on September 15 and briefed the winners, Tariro Makanga and Lilian Choruwa, on what to expect in Capetown. Tariro and Lilian both live in Harare. Tariro, who lives in Highlands, is a broadcast journalist with a private media company, while Lilian, who lives in Borrowdale Brooke, works for a legal firm as a conveyancer. The marathon, which is the only Gold status marathon on the African continent, every year attracts 23 international running clubs and more than 15 000 runners, including some world class athletes.
Zimnat decided to give two social media followers the experience of a lifetime by running a competition on its social media platforms for the all-expenses paid trip to Capetown to participate in the marathon. Entrants to the competition could either tag a Zimnat social media page with a video or picture of how they would get ready for a marathon with a partner or a friend or else tag Zimnat in a posted video of them sharing a story about someone who helped them on their lifes journey.
This was in line with the theme of the marathon, which is Life Is A Marathon, You cant do it alone. The winning entry was the one with the most likes. The competition attracted an overwhelming number of submissions. A total of 55 000 people were reached, with 4 231 engagements, 914 likes and 612 comments in just one week. Tariro managed to secure the tickets for herself and Lilian with 327 likes. Zimnat is sending them both to Capetown so that they encourage and motivate each other as they take on the 10km race. Zimnat Group Marketing Executive Angela Mpala took the winners through what they had won and the activities awaiting them in Capetown, during a handover ceremony at Zimnat House in Harare today.
They are set to depart on September 14 on a direct flight to Capetown, where they will experience world-class service at the Radisson RED, the 4,5 Star hotel where they will reside and dine for the duration of their stay.The pair will run the marathon the following day, after which they will be taken on a sightseeing tour of Capetown. They will travel back to Zimbabwe the next day, September 16. They could hardly contain their excitement at the handover ceremony.
We are excited. We have been running marathons for years and are glad it has reaped rewards. This win coincides with Lilians birthday, which makes it an especially welcome celebration. We are proud to be associated with Zimnat, Tariro said. Zimnat is also sending to Capetown two staff members, who won the trip in a separate promotion for staff.
Zimnat Group CEO Mustafa Sachak said he was pleased with the huge response to the promotion. With this promotion we have managed to cover our most important stakeholders, who are our clients and our staff. In line with our purpose of making life better, we always want to promote health and wellness. We are pleased with the overwhelming response we have received, he said.
Ms Mpala said those who wanted to stay updated on the winners journey and share their travels, experiences and stay in Cape Town could do so by visiting Zimnats social media pages. Zimnat is associated with Sanlam, the largest non-banking financial institution on the continent. It offers businesses and individuals a variety of products, including motor insurance, home insurance, life assurance, travel insurance, funeral cover, health and accident insurance, pension schemes, unit trusts and private wealth management.

Zimnat And Sanlam Continue To Assist Cyclone Idai Victims26 June 2019|In News|2 MinutesShare Post



Zimnat, together with Sanlam, with which Zimnat is associated, last week donated roofing materials to yet another Chimanimani school affected by Cyclone Idai, Muchadziya Primary School in Ngorima.
This follows a similar donation to Gatsi Primary School in Tamba village in Mutasa District barely a week earlier.
The cyclone lifted the roof off a classroom block at Muchadziya Primary School, leaving Grade Four pupils without a roof to shelter them from the bitter winter cold. Two tents have been used as makeshift classrooms following the damage caused by Cyclone Idai.
Zimnat handed over to the school roofing sheets, timber and cement for the repair of the classroom block. The school, which was established in 1934, has an enrolment of 1 220 pupils.
Thanking Zimnat and Sanlam for the donation, Muchadziya Primary School headmaster Amos Gwatida said it had come at an opportune moment as the winter was becoming increasingly cold.

The school had been struggling to find the resources needed to provide warm shelter for the eager learners who were undeterred from coming to school by the tragic events of March and the bitter cold, he said.
Commenting on the donation, Zimnat chief executive Mustafa Sachak said his organisation was happy to partner with Muchadziya Primary School in making life better for the pupils, teachers and the community after the harrowing experience they went through.
We hope that this contribution to the restoration of the classroom block will help bring back normalcy to the school and contribute to the psycho-social healing of the pupils and the people of Muchadziya, whose lives were so tragically affected by the cyclone, he said.
Zimnat is a diversified financial group made up of four business units, namely Zimnat General Insurance, Zimnat Life Assurance, Zimnat Financial Services and Zimnat Asset Management. Sanlam is the largest non-banking financial services group on the continent.

Underwriting Agreement between THI Insurance & Zimnat27 February 2019|In News|3 MinutesShare Post



THI Insurance Ltd (THI) has entered into an UNDERWRITING MANAGEMENT AGENCY agreement with Zimnat General Insurance Ltd (Zimnat) that will result in THI being underwritten by Zimnat, in conjunction with Santam Agriculture, through Zimnats shareholder partnership with Sanlam, the largest non-banking financial institution on the African Continent.
Benefits of the Underwriting Agreement
The agreement, which came into effect on the 1st of January 2019, will enable Zimnat to leverage off THIs agricultural insurance heritage and expertise. THI will ultimately become part of the much larger Zimnat/Sanlam Insurance Group.
THI has an 80 year heritage of agricultural insurance expertise, a market presence and brand reputation that will give Zimnat and Santam Agriculture immediate access to a sector of the insurance market that has pledged to assist in the resurgence of agriculture within the Zimbabwe economy. Agriculture requires a completely different approach to designing insurance products that respond to the changing needs of the Zimbabwe farmer and their upstream and downstream service suppliers. THI, Zimnat and Santam Agriculture have the resources and determination to respond to this demand explained Zimnat Group chief executive Mustafa Sachak.
In return, THI will ultimately become part of a much larger insurance group with Zimnats A  security rating for writing business and the international backing of the Sanlam/Santam group which has a triple A rating. Santam Agriculture, a specialist division of Sanlam has developed technical assistance and state of the art agricultural insurance services, using worldwide and regional research, backed by leading international reinsurers. All these resources will be made available to assist in developing unique risk management and transfer solutions that the Zimbabwe insurance market can offer to its clients he added.
This powerful combination of experience, skills, resources, security and brand heritage will bring significant competitive advantage to THI and Zimnat and this will translate into better service and enhanced product offerings to our broker and client relationships said Stanley Mazorodze the Zimnat General Insurance Managing Director.
This is a really exciting development for the Zimbabwe Insurance industry. It will prove to be of immense benefit to the economy at large and more specifically the agricultural sector. We look forward to rolling it out over the next few months and adding more value to our relationships with brokers, clients and all elements of the agricultural industry chain said Stanley Mazorodze in conclusion.

Zimnat Launches Another Innovative Billboard Campaign18 July 2019|In News, Press Releases|2 MinutesShare Post



Motorists driving towards Harares city centre along Borrowdale Road are likely to be surprised to see just before the racecourse what appears to be boulders falling from a container on a billboard and a car beneath the billboard that appears to have collided with them.
This is Zimnats latest innovative billboard advert intended to illustrate how unexpected accidents can occur, the implication being that it is wise to be insured against accidents.
Whatever life delivers, Zimnat makes it better, is the message displayed on the billboard. The message here is that whatever life throws at one, Zimnat can make the situation better.
The 3D advert which includes a realistic looking container and a real wrecked car at the foot of the billboard, makes the scene that is portrayed of a car colliding with falling boulders look realistic. This makes the advert dramatic and unique.
The launch of the companys latest billboard campaign comes exactly a year after the group made headlines with its 2018 billboard campaign, which included a real car apparently embedded in a wall in the city centre. Last years billboard campaign won the group an award for the Best Outdoor Advert of the Year at the Marketers Association of Zimbabwe Exceptional Marketing Awards.
The rest of the groups billboards throughout the country have been revamped to communicate the new theme of how Zimnat makes life better for its customers. The messaging on the billboards covers all Zimnats business units, which include general insurance, life insurance, asset management and micro finance.
Zimnat is associated with Sanlam, the largest non-banking financial institution on the continent (Africa). The company offers businesses and individuals a variety of products including motor insurance, home insurance, life assurance, travel insurance, funeral cover, health and accident insurance, pension schemes, unit trusts and private wealth management.

Zimnat promoting work health balance9 May 2020|In News|3 MinutesShare Post



By Pamela Mukuze
When we think about our offices or workplaces, fitness and work-health balance is not the first thing that comes to mind. Many of us spend our days sitting at our desks looking at computer screens.
We may even have lunch at our desks. Encouraging fitness in the workplace can be extremely beneficial to both the organisation and staff.
The endorphins released during those few minutes of exercise can help boost the self-confidence and energy. It can also bring more positive attitudes amongst your staff making them less stressed.
A motivated and happy staff is a golden goose for exceptional business performance. Encouraging physical and mental exercise increases productivity in the workplace by boosting mental alertness and reducing staff errors.
Exercising also increases the blood flow to your brain, which helps sharpen your awareness and makes you better prepared to tackle your next big project.
An organisation has fit employees, it is likely there will be less downtime, as the number of staff members calling in sick is significantly reduced. There are many ways for employers to encourage their staff to keep fit, regardless of a companys size.
Zimnat makes life better for its staff by providing a platform for them to wind down and enjoy some bit of exercise.
This is made possible by the provision of onsite sporting facilities for table tennis and pool where staff can come in and have a crack at some games whilst on lunch or after a long days work.
Showing employees that you care about their fitness levels is a great way to boost morale. It demonstrates to team members and colleagues that their health and wellbeing is important to the company they work for.
 
Below are a few benefits of exercise:


It pumps up your endorphins, relieving stress and increasing energy levels.


It improves your mood, making you happier.


It is good for your muscles and bones.


It can help with skin health.


Contact us today on our toll-free number 08080063/4/6. Alternatively, you can send us an email on customercare@zimnat.co.zw.

Mobile agricultural laboratory brings technology to the field19 August 2019|In News, Press Releases|3 MinutesShare Post



The AgriShow held at Borrowdale Racecourse from Thursday last week until Saturday was an eye opener for those who attended it for the first time, with an impressive exhibition of agricultural equipment, much of which was large modern sophisticated machinery.
The show, held by the Agricultural Dealers and Manufacturers Association (ADMA), attracted not only manufacturers of and dealers in farming equipment but many other companies that offer products and services to the agricultural sector.
Among the large exhibits was a 20 metre 30 tonne mobile agricultural laboratory designed to provide agricultural laboratory services in rural areas. The impressive laboratory was stationed at the Zimnat/THI Insurance stand.
The two companies showcased the mobile laboratory, in partnership with Santam Agriculture, a subsidiary of Sanlam, a South African company with which Zimnat is associated.
The laboratory is well equipped. All the equipment, apart from air conditioners, is run with solar power.
The laboratory truck includes a training room, which can be used for training groups of farmers and to introduce agriculture science to youths in remote areas. If the group is too large for the training room, those outside the truck can follow proceedings in the training room on two high definition televisions screens.
 
One of the main purposes of the mobile laboratory is to enable farmers to have soil and water tests done close to where they are, so they do not have to travel long distances to have such samples analysed. An analysis of soil samples is important for deciding on what fertiliser to use.
Zimnat General Insurance chief executive officer Stanley Mazorodze says the laboratory is intended not only to enable emerging farming businesses to do soil and water analysis but also to introduce technology to rural schoolchildren.
The mobile laboratory enables us to bring appropriate technology to the field where it is needed most, he said.
The Zimnat/THI stand had a rural feel to it, with bales of straw being used as seats. The two companies highlighted the agricultural insurance they offer and the benefits to be derived from the joint expertise and resources of Zimnat, Sanlam Agriculture and THI.
THI, Zimnat and Santam Agriculture together have the resources to respond effectively to the changing insurance needs of Zimbabwean farmers and their upstream and downstream service suppliers, Mr Mazorodze said.
There are many risks that farmers face, including variations in the weather and pest infestations that require good agricultural insurance policies, he pointed out.
Zimnat made use of its presence at the AgriShow to highlight other insurance policies that Zimnat offers, such as vehicle insurance, export credit insurance and life assurance, and the financial and asset management services provided by Zimnat Financial Services.

Zimnat helps Providence Pangira fulfil his dream14 November 2019|In News|3 MinutesShare Post



Zimnat recently lived out its purpose of making life better by setting Providence Pangira on a path of realising his lifelong dream of one day becoming a doctor. Providence who achieved brilliant results at Ordinary and Advanced Level despite his deprived background lacked the funds to go to university and was in August awarded a scholarship by Zimnat.
Prior to this Providences life had been one of strife. He enrolled for Form One at Dangamvura High School in Mutare, his family was living in a single rented room in Mutares Chikanga suburb and there was no regular family income. Providence therefore took odd jobs to raise the money for his schooling.
Despite having to work as well as study in far from ideal conditions, Providence achieved seven As and four Bs at Ordinary Level. At Advanced Level he obtained an A in Biology and Bs in Pure Mathematics and Chemistry.
However, with no money to proceed to university it looked as if his ambition of becoming a doctor was unattainable. He ended up taking up a full-time gardening job in Harare. The young mans plight was highlighted earlier in the year on social media and in a weekly publication.
Commenting on the scholarship award Zimnat Group Chief executive officer Mustafa Sachak said As Zimnat our commitment is to making life better for everyone and we hope that those we can assist will be able to realise their full potential. We were impressed by the sheer resilience that Providence demonstrated and thought we should play our part in helping make his dreams come true.
The scholarship offered to Providence includes a commitment from us to paying his university fees and a stipend, as well as the provision of a refurbished laptop to help him with his studies.
Another well-wisher who was also moved by Providences story, paid for his initial tuition fees. As Zimnat we will, therefore, cover all other expenses for his first semester, including his accommodation and an allowance, as well as providing him with the laptop. We will pay the tuition fees for future semesters, said Mr Sachak.
Zimnat, which is a diversified financial group associated with the Sanlam Group, the largest non-banking financial services group in Africa, has managed to continue to remain true to its declared purpose of making life better for others, despite the tough economic conditions, which has made survival the primary focus of most businesses.
As a community driven organisation, Zimnat has assisted several institutions over the past few months, including schools in Chimanimani affected by Cyclone Idai. The business also recently handed over an ablution block for girls at Chizungu Primary School in Epworth to replace the pit toilets that they were previously using.

Zimnat Assists Families Of Deceased Miners25 February 2019|In News|2 MinutesShare Post



Zimnat,one of the leading players in the Zimbabwean life assurance and short-term insurance industries since 1946, has donated funeral services worth $10 000 for the burial of 10 of the miners killed in the Battlefields mining disaster.
The group has made the donation through Mashonaland West Province Minister of State, Mary Mliswa to assist the families of 10 of the miners who lost their lives in the disaster.
The funeral services will be provided by FSG Zimbabwe, which is a subsidiary of Zimnat Life Assurance.
Zimnat Life Assurance is one of the Zimnat groups four business units. The others are Zimnat General Insurance, Zimnat Asset Management and Zimnat Microfinance.
The group is also associated with Sanlam, which is the largest non-banking financial institution on the continent.
The deceased miners were among at least 32 trapped in a shaft at Baxter and Cricket mine when the shaft was flooded as a result of heavy rain.
Eight of the miners were rescued after four days of rescue efforts. The bodies of the 24 who lost their lives in the flooded shaft have been recovered.
This is indeed a sad and tragic incident. We at Zimnat felt we should do something to help those who lost relatives in this national disaster, said Zimnat group chief executive Mustafa Sachak.
While nothing can replace their relatives, we hope that our donation of funeral services will help make their lives a little easier. It is a gesture of solidarity with them in their time of grief, he said.
FSG Zimbabwe is a funeral services company that offers a unique combination of funeral assurance and funeral services.
It combines Hospital Cash Back Cover, Total and Permanent Disability Cover and Funeral Services in one product. All the insured benefits are underwritten by Zimnat Life Assurance Company.

Masawara Group hands over relief packs for 500 families26 March 2019|In News|4 MinutesShare Post



Companies in the Masawara Group on Friday (22 March) handed over relief packs to Minister of Public Service, Labour and Social Welfare Sekai Nzenza and Deputy Minister in the Ministry of Local Government, Public Works, and National Housing Jennifer Mhlanga to help those affected by Cyclone Idai.
The Masawara Group is made up of the Zimnat Insurance Group, Cresta Group of Hotels, Minerva Risk Advisors, Botswana Insurance Company ,Grand Re-Insurance, Sable Chemicals, Dademutande and Joina City.
 
Contents of the Relief Packs
The donated relief packs, consisting of two blankets, two buckets, 10 litres of water, 4kgs sugar, 4kgs rice, four litres of cooking oil, 10kg mealie meal, one pack of matemba, four plastic plates, four spoons, four cups, two bars of soap, two packets of diapers and three packs of sanitary wear will benefit 500 families.
These items were packed in a plastic bin that can be re-used to store food or water. Receiving the donation from Zimnat Group chief executive officer Mustafa Sachak and Minerva managing director Lydia Tanyanyiwa, Minister Nzenza expressed her gratitude for the gesture by the Masawara Group.
I am so pleased and touched by the level of support we have received so far but having come here today I am finding it difficult to fully appreciate it, she said.
What the Masawara Group has done is to think way ahead of us. I am the Minister of Social Welfare and I have worked in relief before but what the Masawara Group has done today is incredible.
You really thought deeply about the basic needs of the people affected. The list of items clearly shows that you put a lot of thought into the basic needs of those people, Ms Nzenza said.
In a speech read on his behalf by Ms Tanyanyiwa, Masawara Group chairman Shingai Mutasa said the Group hoped to do something else for the victims in the long term.
In addition to this immediate relief, we hope to do something in the long term to help minimise the impact of future natural disasters, he said.
We will be looking at doing something permanent in the long run, something that will lessen the impact of such disasters in future, such as perhaps work on building a disaster preparedness shelter, where people can take refuge when such cyclones occur, Mr Mutasa said.

The Handover Ceremony
Deputy Minister for Local Government Public Works and National Housing Jennifer Mhlanga, who was also present for the handover, further commended the Masawara Group for the assistance it was giving.
She assured the group that the supplies would be delivered to the intended recipients. This donation is coming at a time when support is indeed required. I would like to assure the nation and the Masawara Group that a proper accountability with regards to the receipt of donations is in place, Ms Mhlanga said.
In addition to the relief packs, members of staff within Masawara companies contributed food items, clothing, bedding and money to help assist the cyclone victims.

When the unexpected happens14 November 2019|In News, Uncategorized|5 MinutesShare Post



Financial protection through life insurance in the event of death is a topic that often makes people uncomfortable. However, it is not really an entirely unpleasant conversation.
With life insurance from Zimnat you can stop worrying and start enjoying cover and peace of mind. Simply put, life insurance is the exchange of a relatively small payment of money each month for a larger amount of benefit paid out in the event of death.
Zimnat Life Assurance is a member of the Zimnat Insurance Group, a diversified financial group operating in Zimbabwe and associated with the Sanlam Group, which is the largest non-banking financial services group on the continent.
Most people will at various points in their life work or run a business, earn an income, build a family, grow old, retire and pass on.
Life insurance becomes particularly important in instances where you have a family dependent on you.
In a family where everyones livelihood depends on a single income, the moment that income ceases due to either death or retirement everything comes to a standstill.
Life Insurance may not be able to replace the life of a dearly departed family member but it at least guarantees financial security.
Death cannot be controlled or planned. The worst experience for any family is to have to deal with debt while grieving.
If a person dies with an unpaid debt or as a cosignatory on a loan such as a mortgage, the duty of repaying the debt or servicing the loan falls on the surviving signatory or surviving kin, who may be exposed to the wrath of debt collectors.
The heavy burden of finding repayment solutions will fall on them. Life insurance from Zimnat ensures such predicaments are avoided as it covers debts acquired.
The notion that if one spouse has life insurance the other spouse does not need it, is incorrect. The most advisable thing to do is for both spouses to have life insurance policies, especially when there are children involved.
The loss of one spouses income is a financial setback for the family. A life insurance pay-out will cushion the setback, while the other spouse continues to care for the family.
Another misconception about life insurance is that the young and single do not really need it. The opposite is actually true. Better still the premiums are cheaper when you are younger, healthier and at less risk of falling sick.
Financial planning at all stages of your life is vital regardless of your age or marital status. There may be differences in responsibilities and the cover required but when the unexpected happens you need to be prepared for that change in circumstances.
Additionally, life insurance is not limited to spouses and children but can also be taken out for members of the extended family, who often become dependants at some point.
Finally, formally employed people who have life insurance cover through their employer need to remember that it is also important to take out their own personal life cover as the employment-related cover can be affected by loss of employment or change of jobs.
Zimnat is driven to make the lives of its clients better and has the right package for every pocket. Products range from Micro-Funeral Cover to Family Funeral Plan, Security Plan, Personal Pension Plan and Whole Life Plan.
Zimnat ensures that lives continue and dreams are fulfilled. Nothing can beat the peace of mind that comes from knowing that.
Some parting advice: stop worrying about financial obligations for when you are not there, simply get life insurance from Zimnat.

Let's embrace the importance of funeral insurance in Zimbabwe7 February 2023|In Blog, Confidence Boosters!|2 MinutesShare Post



Gamuchirai Sibanda
Heres to the crazy ones. The misfits. The rebels. The troublemakers. The round pegs in the square holes. The ones who see things differently.
Thats why were here today to talk about funeral insurance in Zimbabwe.
When it comes to death, its not a matter of if, but when. And its a time when people want to say goodbye to their loved ones with dignity. But the reality is that funerals in Zimbabwe can be incredibly expensive. And for many families, the cost is simply too much to bear.
Funeral insurance is a solution to this problem. It provides peace of mind and security, knowing that when the time comes, you and your loved ones will be taken care of.
But funeral insurance is not just about the financial aspect. Its also about the emotional aspect. Its about the comfort of knowing that your family wont have to make difficult decisions about how to pay for your funeral. Its about giving your family one less thing to worry about during an already difficult time.
In Zimbabwe, funeral insurance is more than just a good idea. Its a necessity. And thats why we encourage everyone to invest in funeral insurance.
So, lets embrace the importance of funeral insurance in Zimbabwe. Lets be the rebels and the troublemakers who see things differently. Lets make sure that when its time to say goodbye, we do it with dignity and without financial stress.
Heres to the ones who understand the importance of funeral insurance in Zimbabwe. The ones who wont settle for anything less than peace of mind for themselves and their loved ones.
Lets think differently together with Gadziriro/Lungiselelo funeral plan or the Sarudzo/Ukhetho funeral plans today.
Get in touch with our team today and they make your life better

Life insurance: An expression of altruistic love9 May 2020|In News|8 MinutesShare Post



The love for family is an expression of love in its purest form and each family has its own way of expressing that love. One of the common ways families show love to one another is by taking care of each other but what would happen if one of them were to die unexpectedly? Would that expression of love still exist? With life insurance that is possible!
Buying life insurance is altruism at its purist form because you are putting the needs of your loved ones before your own. It is a way to show the one you care most deeply about that you will love and take care of them while you are living and even after you die. However, there are some topics that we as a people just dont like talking about and life insurance one of the major issues that can cause some discomfort, because it sounds expensive and brings to mind your own mortality.
Family discussions around life insurance and estate planning are shunned upon because nobody wants to be reminded about his or her demise and a thought that you dont benefit directly from having life insurance lingers at the back of your minds. But death is an eventuality that we all need to face and make sure you continue to protect your loved ones by adequately preparing them for a life after us because when it happens its pretty much beyond your control. And one of the ways to get your affairs in order is to put life insurance in place. That way should the unexpected happen, you will have everything setup to financially protect your loved ones.
The concept of life insurance is simple: when you die while your policy is active, your family will receive a cash payout from your insurer called a death benefit. The death benefit is to help your family with either your funeral or post burial expenses depending on the type of life insurance you have. Depending on your lifestyle, family structure, and financial position, different types of life insurance coverages exist that can be customized to make sure that your family still feels the warmth of your embrace even after you are gone. However, despite these benefits of life insurance some perfect excuses always come up to help you avoid thinking or talking about life insurance with your loved ones:
As highlighted above many people simply disregard life insurance due to the fear of mortality as well as its perceived cost. Most people overestimate the cost of life insurance however Zimnat Life as an insurer determined to make life better for all, offers different policy types to accommodate the different financial positions of all customers. To determine what your premiums would be, a good first step is to complete a needs analysis to calculate your coverage needs. Then, ask for a quote from any of Zimnats financial advisors at no charge (and no obligation to purchase), so you have nothing to lose. Think about this: if money is tight in the household right now, imagine how tight it would be if you werent around to contribute financially to it?
 
I am young I dont need life insurance right now 
As someone who just graduated from tertiary education, got that dream job and starting a family any thought about your unexpected mortality is the least about your worries. However, as you come of age and become financially independent, we also gain our own dependents whether we are married, or single and such major life milestones also serve as an impetus to start thinking about life insurance. When the thought that young people do not need life insurance crosses your mind ask yourself this question, Can my family manage financially if I am not around? If you cant get a positive answer for this question, then its time you call or get in touch Zimnats readily available financial advisors and start planning for your loved ones.
 
Were finally empty nesters, so nobody is depending on us.
Many a time we attend funerals of our relatives who die after a long happy life only to discover that they did not have a funeral policy! You find yourself with a lot of questions: How a successful person who has lived up to his/her golden age doesnt have a life insurance policy for a death they knew was imminent? This dilemma can be attributed to resigning to the thought that you are now an empty nester your dependents have all come of age and they dont depend on you, so you dont need life insurance. However, just because children have left the nest, doesnt mean theyre completely financially independent, will they be able to pay for your funeral expenses on their own.  Also, remember that life insurance isnt only designed to protect just children; its also to protect the remaining spouse. Would your partner be able to manage without your financial assistance? If you cant get a definitive yes to this question, then its time to visit your nearest Zimnat office or agent and get a quote today!
So, while it is important to show your love in many ways, do not overlook the importance and significance of life insurance. Having a proper life insurance in place can bring peace of mind, knowing that your loved ones and beneficiaries will be taken care of financially when you die. Showing your love shouldnt end at death, and with Zimnat Life Assurance it doesnt.
Zimnat Life Assurance company is a registered life insurance company offering a wide range of customer centric insurance policies ranging from Zimnat Family Funeral Plan, Whole life cover, Zimnat Life security plan, personal pension plan as well as the recently launched Kwedu/Ngekhaya diaspora funeral plan. To find out more about which insurance plan best expresses your love for your loved ones please feel free to get in touch with Zimnats advisors on the following platforms toll-free number 08080063/4/6.

Zimnat Wins Award For First Time Exhibitor4 September 2018|In News|2 MinutesShare Post



The Zimnat Group, which exhibited this year at the Harare Agricultural Show for the first time, won the Best First Commercial Exhibit in Any Sector Award for its stand.
Its stand was judged the best from among more than 100 new entrants in this category. The entire Zimnat group, including its general insurance, life assurance and microfinance companies and the Funeral Services Group, was represented at the stand.
The stand was designed to be similar in its ambience and customer service to any Zimnat branch. Visitors to the stand were able to make general enquiries, sign up for an insurance policy or alter an existing policy, in the same way as they could at any Zimnat branch.
There were branded gifts for those who signed up for any Zimnat policy and for those who referred them to Zimnat. There were also instant pop-a-balloon prizes. There was a daily quiz at the stand, with prizes for correct answers.
Visitors to the stand also had an opportunity to discuss with Zimnat financial advisors investment options and plans for their financial future.
President Emmerson Mnangagwa presented Zimnat with a trophy and certificate at the prize giving ceremony in Glamis Arena.
We are delighted that on the first occasion we exhibited at the Harare Agricultural Show, our stand should be judged the best first time commercial exhibit in any sector, commented Zimnat Group Marketing Executive Angela Mpala.
She said the show provided Zimnat with an opportunity to increase awareness of the various products and services it offered.
The interest shown in our policies and in the financial services we offer was gratifying. It enabled us to demonstrate how we can make peoples lives better, she said.

GCR upgrades Zimnat General Insurance rating to A+30 September 2019|In News|3 MinutesShare Post



Global Credit Rating (GCR) has revised Zimnat General Insurances national scale financial strength (insurance rating) rating to A+(zw) Stable Outlook, from its previous rating of A-(zw). The financial strength rating (formerly claims paying ability) went up two notches.
GCR is the leading emerging market focused ratings agency, rating the full spectrum of security classes based on the best international standards. It accords both International Scale and National Scale ratings. Together with its international affiliates, it rates almost 3 000 organisations and debt issues spanning four continents.
The rationale for Zimnat General Insurances new rating
Explaining the rationale for Zimnat General Insurances new rating, GCR said the insurance companys national scale financial strength rating reflects support from a sound business profile and a disciplined approach to underwriting and capital management.
Offsetting these strengths is liquidity moderation on the back of value preserving strategies, reflecting uncertainties presented by the operating environment.
The insurer has maintained strong brand recognition and evidenced healthy growth momentum over the review period, with a significant increase in market share in the 2018 financial year, underpinned by comparatively high risk uptake in key lines of business, GCR said.
Zimnat General Insurance chief executive officer Stanley Mazorodze said the rating should see clients enjoying enhanced security, innovative insurance products and continued timely claim payments.
More operational flexibility comes with such a good rating, positioning the company to be a strong short-term insurer of choice.
The company will boost its capacity to exercise its philosophy of providing the market with realistic insurance cover products that help clients achieve their set objectives and make their lives better, he said.
To sustain this record A+ rating, Zimnat General Insurance will continue to be creative in developing practical risk solutions for the market and inventive in delivering products best suited to its clients needs. We have every intention of making the lives of all our stakeholders better, he added.
Zimnat General Insurance is a part of the Zimnat group, a diversified financial services group made up of Zimnat General Insurance, Zimnat Life Assurance, Zimnat Microfinance and Zimnat Asset Management. Zimnat is a partner of Sanlam, the largest non-banking financial services group on the continent.

Zimnat scoops top 2021  Global Banking and Finance Award15 June 2021|In News|4 MinutesShare Post



Zimnat, a leading player in the insurance and wealth management industry for more than seven decades, has been awarded the Best Insurance Brand in Zimbabwe in the 2021 Global Banking and Finance Review awards.
The annual business awards which are hosted by the Global Banking and Finance Review magazine are designed to recognize the innovation, achievement, strategy, and inspirational changes taking place within the Global Financial community.
This award comes as a validation of some remarkable innovations and campaigns that have been coming from the financial services giant. In a year in which most organizations particularly insurance services have been struggling to stay afloat, Zimnat has landed first to market and   exciting innovations.
Recognizing the growing importance of WhatsApp based e-commerce in the era of COVID-19, Zimnat launched Zimbabwes first WhatsApp based motor insurance renewal platform. The insurance giant further went on to launch another first for Zimbabwe with the introduction of Jabus Homecoming, Zimbabwes first WhatsApp drama which showcased the real life drama involved in planning for a funeral of a loved one who passes away in the diaspora.
In March 2021, Zimnat made headlines again as it launched innovative life insurance cover options branded the Zimnat LifeCare and Security Plans which allow policyholders to take part in profit sharing realized from their covers. Zimnat launched the products in a very radical manner which involved a mysterious white object placed at Joina City under heavily armed guard. The organization also unveiled decoder insurance, in partnership with DSTV, following the recognition of the role that TV and home entertainment now play in the life of human beings considering the COVID-19 induced lockdown.
Commenting on the award the Zimnat group chief executive officer, Mustafa Sachak, said, We are excited to have been honoured with this prestigious award. As an organization, we have dedicated the 2021 financial year to ensuring that our customers get to reimagine a better life in an era where COVID-19 has changed the way businesses operate.
The new world order calls on us all to think of new ways of making life better for clients and partners by embracing the new norms brought about by COVID-19 that require us to place an emphasis on technology and experiential marketing.
You will realize  that all we have done this year speaks to that theme of a better life reimagined as witnessed by the WhatsApp renewal platform, LifeCare plans and Jabus Homecoming WhatsApp drama. Our goal is to challenge our customers to reimagine how their lives can get even better when they associate with us. We are happy this award recognizes our efforts so far said Mr Sachak.
The award comes at the back of 2 more awards for Best Financial Services Group Zimbabwe 2021 and Most Innovative Financial Services Company Zimbabwe 2021 by the International Business Magazine.
The Zimnat Group has four main business units, namely general insurance, life assurance, asset management and microfinance. The group is driven by a determination to make life better. It is associated with the Sanlam Group, the largest non-banking financial institution on the continent.

Zimnat continues to make life better for the elderly17 July 2020|In News|2 MinutesShare Post



Zimnat, has lived to Its promise to continuously support the elderly by providing free motor insurance cover for some of Melfort Old Peoples Home vehicles for the year 2020, a continuation from 2019.
Located along Mutare Road, in Harare, Melfort Old Peoples Home, which is registered with Help Age, accommodates up to 60 elderly residents, most of whom have been referred to it by the social welfare department.
The home received a donation of vehicles beginning of 2019 and immediately approached the Zimnat Group for assistance with motor insurance.
With the knowledge that the elderly, the communitys senior citizens need as much help as they can get, Zimnat decided to provide free insurance cover for the homes vehicles.
The first-year term of insurance recently expired and Zimnat proactively renewed the insurance for another year.
Upon visiting the home initially, it was discovered that much more needed to be done to help the institution make life better for its residents.
This resulted in the launch of a charity drive dubbed the Heart to Hand Campaign which resulted in a significant donation of goods which included:

A 4-plate gas stove, bed linen, grocery items, clothes, cleaning detergents and agricultural inputs that would help the institution become self-sufficient.

The Group Chief Executive Officer, Mustafa Sachak, then committed to continuously see to it that support is rendered to Melfort Old Peoples Home.
Zimnat has not disappointed, they have proactively renewed the insurance, free of charge for another year.
We endeavour to continue making life better for the Melfort community, despite these challenging times, and hope our efforts will go a long way said Tatenda Marongwe Zimnat Group Marketing Executive
The Zimnat and Masawara family have shown us kindness and love over the past years and we are so grateful that they always help us in whatever way they can said Pastor Francis the homes superintendent.
Zimnat is a diversified financial group that offers products across the financial and insurance spectrum. It has four business units namely Zimnat General Insurance, Zimnat Life Assurance, Zimnat Financial Services and Zimnat Asset Management.

Borrowing responsibly20 February 2023|In Blog, Confidence Boosters!|2 MinutesShare Post



Hello, hello, hello Zimbabwe! Today, were talking about responsible borrowing and how it can benefit you in the long run.
Now, I know what youre thinking: borrowing money doesnt sound like fun at all. But trust me, if you do it responsibly, it can be a smart move. Whether youre looking to start a business, go to school, or just need some extra cash to cover unexpected expenses, borrowing can be a valuable tool.
The key is to make sure youre not overextending yourself. Dont borrow more than you can afford to pay back, and dont take on debt without a plan for how youre going to repay it. This means budgeting carefully, being realistic about your income and expenses, and having a clear idea of how much you can afford to repay each month.
Its also important to shop around for the best loan terms. Dont just take the first loan offer you get  compare interest rates, fees, and repayment schedules from different lenders to find the one that works best for you. And heres where Zimnat Microfinance comes in. They offer a variety of loan options, including business loans, education loans, and personal loans, with competitive interest rates and flexible repayment schedules. Plus, their team of experts can help you navigate the borrowing process and ensure that youre making the best decision for your financial future.
But remember, borrowing isnt a magic solution to your financial problems. Its important to have a solid plan in place for how youre going to use the borrowed funds and how youre going to repay the loan. And if youre not sure whether borrowing is the right choice for you, its always a good idea to talk to a financial advisor or credit counselor.
So there you have it, Zimbabwe. Responsible borrowing can be a smart move if you do it right. And with Zimnat Microfinance, you can have the confidence of knowing that youre working with a reputable lender that has your best interests in mind.

Zimnat dresses up construction men19 July 2023|In Blog, News|2 MinutesShare Post

Zimnat dresses up construction men. In a move that has won the hearts of Zimbabweans, the Zimnat Group, a leading financial services group has launched a heart-warming winter campaign to raise awareness of the importance of financial planning and ensuring one is always adequately covered regardless of age, gender or social standing.
The campaign, launched on one of the coldest days of the 2023 winter season, involved covering the iconic statues of working men at the Construction House in Harare. The statues were covered in Zimnat-branded jackets. Some influencers took to their social media platforms, a picture of the covered statues and Zimnat responded with an underlying message that read Even the strongest men need cover.
The campaigns key message is that everyone needs financial protection, even those who seem to be the most resilient. Many people find themselves under financial strain at some point, hence Zimnat is urging everyone to take steps to protect themselves from the financial hardship phases of life.


We want to remind everyone that winter is not just about the cold weather, said Zimnat Marketing Executive, Tatenda Marongwe Its a denotation of how seasons vary in peoples lives, including the rise of unexpected financial pressures at some point due to various kind of losses for we are exposed to varying risks. That is why its so important to have financial protection in place.
The Zimnat winter campaign has been met with widespread support from Zimbabweans. Many people have taken to social media praise the company for its thoughtfulness and compassion in giving such a reminder in a creative way.
This is such a relevant and important message, said one Twitter user. Its so easy to forget that even I can be vulnerable to financial hardship. This is a real inspiration.
The Zimnat Group winter campaign is a reminder that everyone needs financial protection, no matter how financially strong they may seem. By taking steps to protect yourself from varying risks, you can help to ensure that you are prepared for whatever winter may bring.

Zimbabwe Economic Outlook  First Quarter 201915 February 2019|In News|5 MinutesShare Post



The USD8.16 billion 2019 Budget presented by Finance Minister Professor Mthuli Ncube set the tone for the economic outlook of Zimbabwe for the year 2019. Themed Austerity for Prosperity the budget aimed at introducing tough reforms, possibly with the intention of demonstrating to international financiers that the Zimbabwean government is serious about its economic transformation aspirations.  Austerity is a way to reduce budget deficit by reducing government spending or increasing taxes, or both. Although the economy would perform better with a host of revenue raising measures, the budget aimed more at expenditure management.
Amid many questions about the Zimbabwe currency crisis, the 2019 Budget proclaimed that Zimbabwe would continue using the multi-currency system with the US Dollar as the currency of reference. This came after the Reserve Bank Governor Dr John Mangudya had earlier ordered a separation of Nostro foreign currency accounts from the real-time gross settlement (RTGS) deposits in a bid to preserve the value for those who export and bring foreign currency into the country. The government also maintained that the exchange rate between the bond notes and US Dollar is 1:1. However, in the informal sector the exchange rate is trading at a minimum of 1:3, and in some instances rising to 1:5. The trading of the US dollar at a premium has created increased inflationary pressures on the economy. Trading Economics put the current inflation rate at 49.09%, which is the highest in ten years, with the rate expected to increase to 98% by the end of the year.
Many businesses have adopted a three tier pricing system with increases in bond notes and RTGS prices of various consumer goods and commodities. This led to a rise in salary increment demands by the civil service, with doctors demanding to be paid in US dollars. This means that the fiscal framework that the government was aiming at is likely to remain the same as government expenditure is expected to increase because of an increased wage bill due to salary increment pressures. Because of these likely variations, the finance minister has had to adjust the projected growth rate of the economy from 6.3% previously indicated in the Transitional Stabilisation Programme (TSP) to 4%.
Due to shortages in foreign currency and inefficiencies in foreign currency allocations by the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe, local manufacturers have struggled to import unprocessed raw materials. However, a Foreign Currency Allocation Committee was appointed by the finance ministry to ensure efficient management of foreign currency inflows and outflows. The government also suspended sections of Statutory Instrument 122 of 2017 to increase flow of consumer goods into the market to cater for shortages that the market experienced. Apart from lack of raw materials, these shortages were created by inability of manufacturers to cope with demand of goods after a spate of panic and speculative buying. Because of the increase in the inflow of foreign goods,  Zimbabwes  trade deficit  widened and is continuing to widen  after Zimstat reported that Zimbabwes trade deficit was $2,4 billion as at December 2018.
The success of the austerity measures is hinged on unanimity by all stakeholders that the measures are the only way to steer the economy to success. There is also a strong push by economic and religious players for political players to begin renewed engagement as a measure to create a more stable and predictable economic future for Zimbabwe. Whilst the government tries to create a stable environment, the private sector has to take responsibility to innovate and grab business opportunities that arise in this environment.

Zimnat Offers USD Products7 February 2019|In News, Products|2 MinutesShare Post



Insurance is a means of protection from financial loss, it is a form of risk management, primarily used to hedge against the risk of a contingent or uncertain loss. This means that whatever value you insure your asset for should be sufficient to enable you to replace it or at the very least purchase an asset of the same level as the one you had.  However, the current economic conditions have presented challenges such as inflation and price speculation. In light of this, Zimnat then introduced the option to insure ones assets in US dollars in an effort to make life better for its clients.
In the event of a loss where one has paid their premiums in US dollars the Insurance Company has various options to restore you to your former position. The options include repairing damaged assets, replacing the damaged asset or giving the client cash in lieu of the damages (which will be in US dollars).

Basing values in US dollars hedges against fluctuations in the sum insured. The fact that the US dollar is a relatively stable currency means that the premium one pays will not fluctuate and one can plan for their future payments.
Zimnat General Insurance offers all its short term insurance in US dollar denominations however will continue to offer policies denominated in RTGS value for those who have no access to hard currency. However, where premiums have been paid from an RTGS account, the sums insured will need to be regularly monitored to mitigate against the adverse effects of inflationary pressures in the business environment that lead to underinsurance.
Zimnat, which is one of the countrys leading insurance and financial services companies, has been a leading voice in protecting the assets of those who insure with them. This is in line with its purpose of making life better.
Call 086 7700 4952 or email directbusiness@zimnat.co.zw to find out more or purchase a US dollars policy.

Zimnat Marathon Raises $7 000 For Cebisani Ndlovus Surgery20 November 2018|In News|2 MinutesShare Post



Zimnats first charity marathon, which was held at Barclays Sports Club in Harare on November 10, managed to raise almost the whole amount originally quoted for 30-year-old Bulawayo resident Cebisani Ndlovus spinal cord surgery.
When Mr Ndlovu approached Zimnat for assistance, the amount needed at that time for the surgery at Mater Dei Hospital in Bulawayo was $7 500. The marathon raised almost $7 000.
Mr Ndlovu, who holds a Bachelor of Commerce (B.Com.) Honours degree in Risk Management and Insurance, has difficulty walking, even with the aid of crutches, which he first started using in Form One.
Moved by his plight, Zimnat decided to hold a charity marathon to raise as much of the money as possible. Hundreds of people were touched by Zimnats plea to assist Mr Ndlovu, as evidenced by the turnout for the run, with 740 people taking part in the half-marathon or runs over shorter distances and others donating towards the cause.
Participants also had an opportunity to talk to Mr Ndlovu and have pictures taken with him, as he came to witness the marathon.
The races, which started at 5.30 am, were pegged at 5km, 10km and 21km, with the majority of people taking part in the 5km run. Altogether, $6 810 dollars were raised.
Zimnat has paid out $550 of this amount for a Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scan, which will facilitate an updated quotation for the surgery required.
The response to our plea for members of the public to take part in this marathon to help Mr Ndlovu was overwhelming, commented Zimnat group marketing executive Angela Mpala.
Zimnat is driven by a passion to empower companies and clients to reach their full potential and to making life better for others. We would like to thank all those who participated in the marathon or made donations towards this cause for helping us to make life better for Mr Ndlovu, she said.
The Zimnat Group, which is comprised of Zimnat Life Assurance, Zimnat General Insurance, Zimnat Asset Management and Zimnat Financial Services, is associated with Sanlam, the biggest non-banking financial services group on the continent.

Zimnat Promotes healthy lifestyles for the Tongaat Community25 October 2023|In News|3 MinutesShare Post



 

It was a fun-filled and eventful weekend for the Triangle and Hippo Valley communities as Zimnat fully lived up to their commitment to Make life better through a soccer and netball tournament sponsored by the Zimnat Life Assurance division. The tournament commenced on the 2nd of September 2023 with a total of 52 soccer teams and 50 netball teams from both Triangle and Hippo Valley. Weekly knock-out games were held leading up to the finals that were played on Saturday the 14th and Sunday the 15th of October. DJ Greens chimhamha chesugar sweetened all the matches with her charismatic nature and unmatched passion for empowering the Tongaat community, this time in partnership with Zimnat Life Assurance. The competing teams and supportive crowds were enamored by the wealth of financial knowledge shared during the tournament by the Zimnat Life Assurance financial advisors and executive management.

 
Saturday, the 14th of October saw the Mufakose and Eastern United soccer teams battle for the Triangle championship whilst Chitepo faced Eastern United as its opponent for the Triangle netball championship. The thrilling and cutthroat finals took place at the prestigious Gibbo stadium in Triangle. The Eastern United teams proudly walked away with the coveted Triangle Championship title for both soccer and netball.
Games played on Sunday at the Chishamiso stadium were just as riveting with the Hippo Valley Mteri FC and Chiefhawk soccer teams battling for the championship title whilst the Lundi Queens and Fortified netball teams also competed for the Hippo Valley championship. The Saturday and Sunday games attracted an impressive crowd with both stadiums filling up and full of lively interactions. These games were aired live on the radio by Avuxeni, a Chiredzi-based radio station.
The Zimnat team came in full support along with Mr Workmore Chimweta, the Zimnat Life Assurance Managing Director. He assured that they will host yet another community-driven tournament in 2024. The key message revolved around ubuntu and how this is expressed when we do life together to make life better.
 

The tournament festivities were sealed by a celebratory braai hosted by Zimnat Life Assurance at the vibrant Nandi Stop Over in Chiredzi. A beast was slaughtered for this braai to symbolize the coming together of the Zimnat and Tongaat families. In our culture cattle are a symbol of wealth and the unifying of families. It was thus befitting for this to be a part of the celebrations. Additionally, winning teams walked away with cash prizes worth USD1,500, a full sports kit, and Zimnat branded wear.

Zimnat launches digital magazine17 July 2020|In News|3 MinutesShare Post



Zimnat has launched a digital financial services magazine, dubbed Zimnat Insider, in its continuous quest to make life better and respond to the environment. This launch of the digital magazine comes at an opportune time where we are faced with a pandemic which calls for social distancing and minimising contact.
The Zimnat Insider Magazine is a digital financial services magazine designed to provide educative and entertaining information to our customers and stakeholders at large. The magazine will feature topics ranging from socio-economic issues, insurance, wealth management and entertainment. The magazine will be available from the Zimnat website and the groups social media pages.  Copies will also be sent directly to  Zimnat clients.
Commenting on the launch of the magazine, Zimnat Group CEO Mustafa Sachak said, as Zimnat our purpose is to make life better in all our endeavours and this new magazine will help bridge the information gap with regards to financial advice to help people realise their full potential. The idea of publishing a magazine came up after we realised that as financial service providers in the country, we could do more to promote financial literacy and given the current lockdown regulations in place most people have ample time on their hands to read.
We acknowledge that the news cycles have been dominated by Covid-19 and this can be a bit overwhelming and disconcerting to some, so we hope that this new publication will help all our stakeholders keep their minds preoccupied and active. To ensure we cater for the psychosocial well-being of the family in these trying times, the magazines also have brain teasers that allow readers to participate as families. We hope this will also give families the opportunity to also use their digital devices in a manner that promotes social cohesion, said Mr Sachak.
The launch of the digital magazine comes after the organisation was featured in the Fintech Magazine of April 2020 for its trailblazing efforts in digital transformation in the Zimbabwean insurance sector.
The group has seen various innovations that seek to make life better for Zimbabweans being launched this year with the most recent one being the launch of the inflation adjusted Gadziriro funeral cash plan.
Zimnat is a diversified financial services group made up of Zimnat General Insurance, Zimnat Asset Management, Zimnat Microfinance and Zimnat Life Assurance. The group is associated with Sanlam the largest non-banking financial services group on the continent.

IMPACT OF COVID-19 AND THE ECONOMIC LANDSCAPE POST COVID-19 - A ZIMBABWEAN CONTEXT13 August 2020|In News|3 MinutesShare Post



 By Takudzwa Sherekete
 Research Manager takudzwas@zam.co.zw
COVID  19 AND ITS IMPACT ON THE GLOBAL ECONOMY
The Covid-19 virus has resulted in one of the deepest recessions globally. Most countries are expected to face economic recessions.
The worst affected sectors include tourism industry, transportation and construction and real estate.
On the other hand, the pandemic bodes well for the healthcare industry and the telecommunication and media industries.
The chart below shows an overview of the potential impact of the Covid-19 pandemic by economic sector.

The global economy was at its lowest during the March 2020 and has since started to recover as most countries have commenced the process of relaxing lockdown conditions.
However, the risk of a second wave of infections still poses a significant risk on the global economy. The extent of the recession is dependent on a few pre-Covid-19 economic conditions.
Namely, countries with higher pre-crisis vulnerabilities and trade and financial linkages with the global economy are more impacted by the crisis.
According to the IMF World Economic Outlook (WEO) as at June, the global economy is estimated to contract by circa 4.9%, despite the extraordinary efforts of governments to counter the downturn with fiscal and monetary policy support.
Fiscal and monetary policy support is according to the IMF estimated to have reached US$9 trillion as at May 2020. The breakdown looks like this:

direct budget support is currently estimated at US$4.4 trillion globally, and additional public-sector loans and equity injections, guarantees, and other quasifiscal operations (such as non-commercial activity of public corporations) amount to another US$4.6 trillion.


The World Banks Outlook Report as at June also highlighted that the pandemic may have a long-term impact on the Emerging Market economies as many had already been forecasted to experience a slowdown in economic growth during 2020.
In order to soften the social and economic impact on the informal sector, policy makers are expected to provide timely and appropriate solutions.
This brief paper seeks to summarize the salient issues impacting the global economy and provide an outlook on the Zimbabwean economy post-Covid 19.

Zimnat hosts online cocktail party for clients17 July 2020|In News|3 MinutesShare Post



Zimnat has found an innovative way to interact with and entertain its clients during the Covid19 lockdown, by holding online cocktail parties, which it has branded Gungano/Umhlangano Online Cocktail Parties.
The first of these was held today (Friday) for Zimnat Life Assurance corporate customers. More will be held in the coming weeks.
Invitations to attend the online cocktail party were sent out earlier in the week. Food and drinks were delivered to each invited clients preferred location 30 minutes before the online party began.
The online cocktail party was run in a similar way to normal client cocktail parties with food, drinks, entertainment and customers were able to interact with the organisations management team.
It is believed to be the first Zimbabwean company to hold such an event. It is certainly the first within the countrys insurance services industry to do so.
Watch video in the link below:
http://https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJT_uTtc8DM
Zimnat group marketing executive Tatenda Marongwe said the idea was inspired by the realisation that Zimnat needed to maintain its engagement with customers, regardless of the Covid-19 pandemic, to provide them with much needed reassurance.
Because of the value Zimnat places on keeping its customers engaged, we decided to find an alternative to the cocktail parties we usually hold for them and not allow the pandemic to prevent us from interacting with them. We believe in dancing in the rain.
Thats how the concept of the Gungano/Umhlangano Online Cocktail Party was born. Todays event was the first such online cocktail party. It was so successful that we will continue to hold such events for various clusters of clients until such a time when we can once again meet with them physically, she said.
It has been a difficult time for us all, including our customers. We realised that at some point we needed to work around the new normal and find ways to continuously engage with our customers, as we continue to make their lives better, she added.
Zimnat has put in place protocols, in line with World Health Organisation recommendations, to play its part in contributing to efforts to flatten the Covid19 curve. Most employees are working from home. Customers are being encouraged to minimise visits to Zimnat offices, making use instead of virtual platforms for all enquiries.
The Zimnat Group, which is a diversified financial services group associated with Sanlam, the largest non-banking financial services group on the continent, incorporates Zimnat Life Assurance, Zimnat General Insurance, Zimnat Financial Services, Zimnat Asset Management and the Funeral Services Group.
